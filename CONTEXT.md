# Dienstagskicken — Domain Context

Dienstagskicken ("Tuesday Kicking") is a mobile-first web app for Verein Weißkirchen's Tuesday football group (~40 players). It digitises their weekly paper match sheet so admins can record attendance, teams, and goals from their phones, and the full group can view live standings and all-time records.

## Domain Glossary

Use these terms exactly as written. Do not substitute synonyms.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Spieler** | A player. Has a name, an `aktiv` flag, and a `vereinsmitglied` flag. ~40 in the pool; no self-registration. |
| **Vereinsmitglied** | Administrative flag on Spieler. Marks whether the player is a formal club member. No effect on stats, leaderboards, or match participation — display/admin only. |
| **Saison** | A season, identified by calendar year (integer). Awards and leaderboards are scoped per Saison. |
| **Spiel** | A match. Has a date, a Saison FK, a status, and an optional beer-bringer (Spieler FK). |
| **Spielteilnahme** | Match participation — the join between Spieler and Spiel. Records which team the player was on and an optional points override. |
| **Tor** | A goal event. Records scorer, optional assist, eigentor flag, and which team the goal is attributed to. |
| **Eigentor** | An own goal. Counts toward the **opposing** team's score; excluded from the scorer's personal Tore tally. The `team` field on Tor is the team that **benefits** (conceding team). |
| **Rot** | One of the two fixed teams. Identifier: `Rot`. Accent colour: `#ef4444`. |
| **Gelb** | The other fixed team. Identifier: `Gelb`. Accent colour: `#eab308`. |
| **Bierliste** | "Beer list" — award category tracking who brought beer to the most matches. |
| **Torjägerliste** | Top scorers leaderboard (Eigentore excluded from personal tally). |
| **Vorlagenliste** | Top assists leaderboard. |
| **Punktetabelle** | Points table — 3 pts for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss, per player. |
| **Anwesenheitsliste** | Attendance list — matches attended per player. |
| **Ewige Tabelle** | All-time leaderboard aggregated across all Saisons. |
| **Zustandsmaschine** | The match state machine. Controls valid Spiel status transitions. |

## Match State Machine

```
geplant ──→ teams_zugewiesen ──→ abgeschlossen
    │
    └──→ abgesagt
```

- `geplant` — planned; date, beer bringer, and attendees recorded
- `teams_zugewiesen` — teams assigned; each Spielteilnahme has Rot or Gelb
- `abgeschlossen` — completed; goals recorded, match closed
- `abgesagt` — cancelled from `geplant`; remains in history, excluded from all stats

Only forward transitions are valid. `abgeschlossen` and `abgesagt` are terminal. Implemented in `src/lib/zustandsmaschine.ts`.

---

## Invariants

These rules are non-negotiable and enforced throughout the codebase:

1. **Score is never stored.** It is always derived: `COUNT(Tor WHERE team=Rot AND NOT eigentor) + COUNT(Tor WHERE eigentor AND team=Gelb)` for Rot, symmetric for Gelb. See `src/lib/score.ts` → `deriveScore()`. (ADR-0002)

2. **Eigentore are excluded from the scorer's Tore count.** They still contribute to the conceding team's score.

3. **Cancelled matches (`abgesagt`) are excluded from all statistics** — goals, assists, points, attendance, beer.

4. **Ties are not broken.** Tied players share the same rank. The next rank is the tied players' position + their count (dense competition ranking).

5. **`pointsOverride` on Spielteilnahme** overrides which team's result the player receives points for, without changing their actual team assignment.

6. **Rot and Gelb are the only two team identifiers.** They are not configurable. (ADR-0003)

7. **Inactive Spieler (`aktiv = false`) are never shown in match setup pickers.** They are only visible on the `/admin/spieler` management page.

8. **Player picker ordering uses rolling-window activity buckets.** Three buckets, in order: (1) Spielteilnahme in last 90 days, (2) Spielteilnahme in last 365 days but not last 90, (3) no participation in the last year. Within each bucket, alphabetical by name. Applies to match setup only — `/admin/spieler` is alphabetical.

## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-0001 — EU hosting on Hetzner
Deploy to a Hetzner VPS (EU-based) via Docker + docker-compose + Caddy. Vercel and Railway default to US regions; GDPR requires member data (names, stats) to stay in the EU. This adds operational overhead but is non-negotiable.

### ADR-0002 — Score derived from events, never stored
No score field on Spiel. Score is always computed from Tor records. Prevents score/event drift and keeps the event log as the single source of truth.

### ADR-0003 — Rot and Gelb as fixed team identifiers
Teams are always Rot and Gelb — fixed values, not configurable names. Reflects the group's paper sheet and coloured bibs. Keeps the data model simple.

### ADR-0004 — Credentials auth, not OAuth
NextAuth.js credentials provider (username + password). Admin list is small and self-contained; OAuth would introduce a third-party dependency and account-suspension risk for a private group tool. Credentials are stored as `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` env var (format: `user:pass,user2:pass2`).

## Module Map

| Module | Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `zustandsmaschine` | `src/lib/zustandsmaschine.ts` | Pure: validates and executes Spiel status transitions |
| `score` | `src/lib/score.ts` | Pure: derives `{ rot, gelb }` score from a list of Tor records |
| `statistik-engine` | `src/lib/statistik-engine.ts` | Pure: computes all five leaderboard categories for a given Saison scope or all-time |
| `spieluebersicht` | `src/lib/spieluebersicht.ts` | Pure: formats match display data (derived score, winner, scorer lists with eigentor attribution) |
| `auth-utils` | `src/lib/auth-utils.ts` | Pure: credential parsing, admin path detection, session validation |
| `auth` | `src/lib/auth.ts` | NextAuth config — credentials provider wired to `auth-utils` |
| `datum-utils` | `src/lib/datum-utils.ts` | Pure date helpers — e.g. `naechstenDienstagBerechnen()` |
| `prisma` | `src/lib/prisma.ts` | Prisma client singleton with `@prisma/adapter-pg` (Prisma v7 requirement) |

Pure modules (`zustandsmaschine`, `score`, `statistik-engine`, `spieluebersicht`, `auth-utils`, `datum-utils`) take data as arguments and return results — no DB calls, no side effects. Test them with in-memory fixture data.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16 + TypeScript** — App Router, Server Components, Server Actions
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** — mobile-first; Rot (`--rot: #ef4444`) and Gelb (`--gelb: #eab308`) defined as CSS variables
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma v7** — schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`; DB connection via `prisma.config.ts` + `@prisma/adapter-pg` (Prisma v7 no longer accepts `url` in the datasource block)
- **NextAuth.js** — credentials provider; JWT sessions; admin whitelist in `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` env var
- **Vitest** — unit tests for all pure modules; run with `vitest run`
- **Playwright** — E2E tests against a real local Next.js server + real PostgreSQL; run with `playwright test`
- **Docker + docker-compose** — local dev (app + PostgreSQL); `docker-compose up -d db` to start DB only
- **Caddy** — production reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt TLS
- **GitHub Actions** — CI (tsc → lint → vitest → playwright) and SSH deploy to Hetzner on merge to `main`

## Language

All UI copy is in **German**. Domain terms (Spieler, Saison, Spiel, etc.) are used in code identifiers, route names, and UI labels without translation.
